# hw8


Name: Jack Guerre  
Purpose: Create a matrix library  
Files: matrixLibrary.cpp (Creates a matrix class with operators using vectors), matrixLibrary.c (Creates functions that work with operations)  
Build Instructions:  
  For C++ version:  
  g++ -std=c++11 matrix.cpp -o matrix_cpp  
  ./matrix_cpp  
For C version:  
  gcc -std=c99 matrix.c -o matrix_c  
  ./matrix_c  
Testing Methodology: Compile and run both files, the main function has the equation you need to run. The numbers are hard-coded into the code.
