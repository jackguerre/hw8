Name: Jack Guerre  
Purpose: Create a matrix library  
Files:  
  matrixLibrary.cpp (Creates a matrix class with operators using vectors)  
  matrixLibrary.c (Creates functions that work with operations)  
  README (this file)

Build Instructions:  
  For C++ version:  
  g++ -std=c++11 matrixLibrary.cpp -o matrixLibraryCpp  
  ./matrixLibraryCpp  
For C version:  
  gcc -std=c99 matrixLibrary.c -o matrixLibraryC  
  ./matrixLibraryC  

Testing Methodology: Compile and run both files, the main function has the equation you need to run. The numbers are hard-coded into the code.
